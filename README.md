# ðŸŒ± Crop Disease Detection  

This repository contains my **final year diploma project** which falls under the **AI/ML domain**.  
The project focuses on identifying plant diseases from leaf images using **Deep Learning** and **Image Processing** techniques.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview  

Farmers often face crop losses due to undetected plant diseases.  
This system allows users to upload an image of a crop leaf, and the model predicts whether the plant is healthy or diseased and specifies the disease category.

**Key Features:**  
- Upload an image of a crop leaf.  
- Detect disease type using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
- Provide preventive measures or suggestions (optional extension).
